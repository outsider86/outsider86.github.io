I am a Ph.D. student in the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/) (Member of the National Academy of Engineering). My research focuses on **Reinforcement Learning for Control** and **Dexterous Manipulation**.

Prior to Berkeley, I received dual bachelor's degrees in Mechanics and Aerospace Engineering from Tsinghua University, where I graduated ranked 1st in my class with a GPA of 3.90.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of reinforcement learning, control theory, and robotics. I am particularly interested in:

- **Domain Adaptation**: Developing methods that enable policies to generalize across different environments and dynamics
- **Policy Customization**: Creating frameworks for test-time adaptation and personalization of learned behaviors
- **Model-based Reinforcement Learning**: Improving sample efficiency and performance through learned dynamics models
- **Dexterous Manipulation**: Applying RL techniques to complex robotic manipulation tasks

## Recent Work

I have been working on several exciting projects, including:
- **Domain Adaptive Diffusion Policy (DADP)**: A novel approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance on domain adaptation tasks
- **Residual Q-Learning**: Enabling test-time policy customization on super-human level agents like GT Sophy 1.0
- **Discrete Diffusion for VLA**: Improving the efficiency and language-following ability of vision-language-action models

My work has been published at top-tier venues including ICLR, ICRA, and L4DC, with several papers currently under review.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration or have questions about my research!
