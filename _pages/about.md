I am a Ph.D. student in the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, advised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/) (Member of the National Academy of Engineering).
Prior to that, I received dual bachelor's degrees in Mechanics and Aerospace from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Prof. Shengbo Eben Li](https://www.svm.tsinghua.edu.cn/essay/80/1835.html).

I worked on **Transferable and Scalable Reinforcement Learning for Robotics**.
Specifically, I care how RL agent can **digest the scaled model size/ data/ training**, and can be **efficiently generalized across different embodiments/ tasks/ dynamics**.


Outside of research, I love gaming with large-scale strategy systems such as [Stellaris](https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/), [Civilization VI](https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI/), and [Victoria 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/). I'm also passionate about singing and served as one of the tenor leads in the [Choir of Tsinghua University](https://space.bilibili.com/523118342?spm_id_from=333.788.upinfo.detail.click). Check out [my favorite performance](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15s421w7s5/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=4bb08282d73ec5e4189b313a491621b2)!
